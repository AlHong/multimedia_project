						<h2>Nintendo shares Switch specs, still won’t detail its Nvidia chip</h2>

							We know a ton about the Nintendo Switch. It’s $300. It comes out March 3. It weighs 398 grams. It supports IEEE 802.11 ac wireless standards. And it is 13.9mm thick. But the gaming company still isn’t spilling the details about the processor that powers its new hardware.

							Nintendo has published a lengthy list of specs for its hybrid handheld/home Switch console, so that you know what you’re getting for your $300. Except the company won’t say anything more about the CPU and CPU inside of the Switch beyond its go-to line that it’s an “Nvidia customized Tegra processor.” From the first Switch reveal trailer in October, Nvidia and Nintendo have both publicly declined the opportunity to reveal the custom Tegra’s architecture, process, or clock speed. GamesBeat has independently revealed via multiple sources that the Switch will run on a chip similar to what is inside Nvidia’s Shield TV product, which is based on the company’s last-generation Maxwell architecture. That makes the Switch less powerful than the PlayStation 4 from competitor Sony Interactive Entertainment.

							And, at this point, it’s unlikely that Nintendo will ever share the exact specifications of the Switch’s Tegra with consumers. Earlier this month, the publisher held its Switch Presentation event in Tokyo, which it livestreamed around the world. Instead of spending a lot of time on technical specifications, the company chose to show games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Odyssey running on the Switch. Clearly, the publisher wants people talking about its games and not about how much more power efficient Nvidia’s Pascal graphics architecture is than Maxwell.

							Of course, you can’t stop the signal. And we’re only a handful of weeks away from gamers getting their hands on the Switch, and you can bet that more than a few people are going to tear their system open to give the system’s innards a looking over with a magnifying glass. At that point, anyone who cares will learn those specs, and the rest of us can continue enjoying The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

						<h2>Budget Google Pixel 2 leaked alongside enhanced premium model</h2>

							Google is set to give us some hefty upgrades on its second generation Pixel smartphone, but it looks as if we’ll also be treated to a more affordable Google Pixel 2. 

							According to a source speaking to 9to5Google, Google is planning a budget Pixel phone as well as an improved Pixel 2 handset that will see upgrades in its chipset and camera. 

							The premium Google Pixel 2 will apparently sport an even higher price tag though, which would be a surprising move from the search giant as the pricing of its current Pixel duo has been partly blamed for some lackluster sales figures.

							Less Pixel for less money

							News of a cheaper Pixel has piqued our interest though, as Google has a history of more affordable devices from its now-defunct Nexus range. 

							The source claims that a lower-powered Pixel with lesser specs and a small price tag is currently being tested, so fingers crossed it’ll arrive later this year.

							This is the same source which claimed that the second generation Pixels will sport waterproof bodies – rather than the splashproof protection on the current handsets – and thus should be taken with a pinch of salt. They have provided correct Google information in the past though.

						<h2>These Shoes Let You Feel The Surface You're Walking On in Virtual Reality</h2>
					</header>

					<aside>

							There’s an obsession with “immersion” in virtual reality. Everyone wants to find the next way to make VR experiences feel more real. So far, the best ways to do it have been room tracking sensors that let you walk around a designated area or wireless hand controllers that let you grab things in the virtual world. Now, a new startup is betting big on plastic shoes that give you a sensation that you’re actually walking around in the virtual world.

							The Cerevo Taclim is pair of tactile feedback shoes and wireless hand controllers made to work with Google VR experiences that make it feel like you’re actually walking on the surface shown in the virtual world. That means snow crunches beneath your feet, grains of sand rub against your toes, and water splashes as you wade around in virtual puddles—at least in theory.

							The idea is totally freaking insane, and it immediately caught my attention at this year’s CES. Virtual reality has been one of these hyped-up categories for years, but it’s always fallen short of complete immersion. I decided I had to give the Taclim shoes and controllers a chance in order to see if its dramatically improved any VR experiences.

							The creator of the shoes booted up a fighting game, and I was asked to walk into the arena where I’d fight a bunch of robots. As i entered the arena, I stepped on water, concrete, and sand. Each different element provided a different sensation on my toes, the balls of my feet, and my heels. I wouldn’t call it realistic, but the sensation did at least somewhat help me suspend my disbelief that I wasn’t actually in the middle of a crowded convention center in Las Vegas.	

							The shoes themselves are really easy to strap on and are relatively simple builds. There are two straps that go across the top of your feet like a pair of Tevas or other athletic sandals. There are tactile feedback motors in both the front and rear of the shoes and also across one of the straps. It’s enough to give you a tingly feeling in your feet as you march in place, walking around a virtual world. There are also motors in the palms of the hand controllers that come with the shoes, though I didn’t find them all that helpful, and frankly, they weren’t that innovative. They looked like modified versions of the Oculus Touch controllers.

							Cerevo says it hopes to ship the Taclim set in the fall of 2017, and the pair of controllers and shoes will cost between $1,000-$1,500. It’s a steep price to pay, especially since its only compatible with Google VR at the moment, but Cerevo says it hopes to add bigger platforms—namely Oculus, Steam VR, and PlayStation VR—in the near future. We certainly hope so because without the support of those bigger platforms, these shoes will be dead on arrival. Still, it’s a very fun accessory to play with and it would be even better if they worked with room tracking sensors. Then, finally, we might get some real immersion.
